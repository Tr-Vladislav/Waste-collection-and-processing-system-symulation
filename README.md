# Waste-collection-and-processing-system-symulation
**Waste Collection System Simulation** is a distributed application using TCP/IP sockets. It simulates waste disposal interactions between houses, an office, tankers, and a sewage plant. Houses request waste removal, the office manages orders, tankers transport waste, and the sewage plant processes it.
